🛠️ Landing Page Fix Instructions

Objective: Transform the current landing page into a high-converting, client-generating page by applying proven conversion principles.

1. Audience Clarity

Rewrite copy to speak directly to one target audience (no generic “we serve everyone” messaging).

Highlight specific problems and desired outcomes of the ideal customer.

2. Headline Update

Replace current headline with one that is:

Clear and specific about the offer

States the end result the visitor wants

Avoids being clever/vague

Example: "Get a Spotless Home with Eco-Friendly Cleaning in Just One Visit"

3. Copywriting: Features → Benefits

Audit existing text.

For every feature, answer “So what?” → rewrite into a customer-focused benefit.

Example: “Eco-friendly products” → “Safe for kids and pets.”

4. Call-to-Action (CTA)

Remove all secondary buttons, navigation links, and social icons from the landing page.

Keep ONE main CTA throughout the page (e.g., "Book Your Free Consultation").

Repeat CTA in hero, mid-page, and bottom section.

5. Trust Builders

Add 3–5 testimonials with real names/photos.

Insert client logos, credentials, or certifications (if available).

Add trust badges near forms (e.g., “100% Secure,” “No Spam”).

Optional: Include a guarantee statement (e.g., “Satisfaction Guaranteed or Your Money Back”).

6. Design Cleanup

Simplify layout:

More white space

Consistent font & color palette (max 2–3 colors)

Remove clutter or unnecessary graphics

Organize page flow:

Headline → Benefits → Social Proof → CTA

7. Speed & Mobile Optimization

Optimize all images (compressed, WebP format).

Test mobile responsiveness (adjust spacing/fonts for smaller screens).

Minimize scripts and unnecessary animations.

Ensure page loads < 2 seconds.
